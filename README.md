As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, social problems have arisen worldwide for which it was necessary to find solutions during the 48-hour hackathon.

People who were previously dependent on the help of others have been particularly affected by the crisis.

In Germany, it is the local food banks that ensure that those in need are regularly supplied with food. They live from volunteers who collect, sort and distribute the food. However, most of these volunteers are elderly people themselves, who belong to the COVID-19 risk group. If these volunteers stay at home for their own safety, many of the boards will no longer have enough support and will have to close.

Our goal is to connect motivated young volunteers with blackboards in their environment to prevent or reverse crisis-related closures.
